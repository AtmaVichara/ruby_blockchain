# Blockchain in Ruby

## Little Intro into the What and Why?
* WHAT: This is a simple implementation of a barebones blockchain and cryptocurrency in ruby.
* WHY: The main reason for building this was for learning purposes to understand how a blockchain works, and by extension how cryptocurrencies are made from a blockchain.

## Current State (updated: Sunday, January 21, 2018, 17:45:30)
* Currently this is a barebones blockchain... Or at least the most simple case of one. While it can technically be called a blockchain in it's current form, in reality it is just a linked list with hashes, that also verifies the hashes for proof of work. To be more in line with a blockchain, implementing a merkle tree is the next step.

## Future Plans
* The future goal for this little project is to flesh out a fully fleshed out blockchain app.
* At the moment, the current issues are further implementations that have yet to be added. More research and study must be conducted before I am able to do so.
