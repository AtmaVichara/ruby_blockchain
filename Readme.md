# Blockchain in Ruby

## Little Intro into the What and Why?
* WHAT: This is a simple implementation of a barebones blockchain and cryptocurrency in ruby.
* WHY: The main reason for building this was for learning purposes to understand how a blockchain works, and by extension how cryptocurrencies are made from a blockchain.

## Future Plans
* The future goal for this little project is to flesh out a fully fleshed out blockchain app.
* At the moment, the current issues are further implementations that have yet to be added. More research and study must be conducted before I am able to do so.
